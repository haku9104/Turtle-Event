# Turtle-Event
A Spring application to create and browse events.


Turtle Event is my main project at Codecool, it is still under development in Spring boot. 


Our main goal is to create a platform where you can create or browse events. 
The first version of the backend is finished, by now we have working PSQL database generated by hibernate. 
We are using postman to test our APIs. 
The next step is frontend, where we are using a REACT template, and already has some finished pages. 


(Frontend is not yet the part of the repository)
